Documentation file (this can be a revision of your existing readme file): An overview/outline/draft of the material that you will provide to users to guide them through using your program. Examples of elements to include are:
* introduction to the logic ("sales pitch") for your program
* names of functions/methods and the parameters that they take
* example use cases (e.g. why would someone use this program)
* if your program takes data as input: the necessary structure of the data to be read, such as:
      * the format of the datafile
      * descriptive field names and their required content formatting (e.g. strings, integers)
      * whether variable names must be included and/or whether fields must be in a specified order, etc.
