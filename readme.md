1: For my project, I plan to use tkinter to create a text-based program that takes the user input of a simple sentence and converts it into a basic syntax tree. I plan to either ask the user to provide the part of speech for each word (to allow for more flexibility), or I will use pre-set lists of common nouns and verbs. I will definitely start by accepting simple sentences ("The dog ate the steak."), and eventually I will perhaps try to expand the scope to include relatively more complex sentences ("The gift was handed to her by him.") 

2a: Function 1: Accept user input of a simple sentence and split the sentence into words

2b: Function 2: Categorize each word into a part of speech and analyze the sentence structure

2c: Function 3: Plug each word into a syntax tree and format it accordingly

3: I plan to complete this project on my own.
