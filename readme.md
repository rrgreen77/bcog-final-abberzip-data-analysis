4 a & b. If you are doing a group project, very brief statements (1-2 sentences each) describing:
How work will be divided (assigned and tracked) among group members, and;
How (and how often!) team members will communicate with each other about the project (such as weekly meetings, ongoing group chat, etc.)
Submit the URL for your public project repository for this assignment in Canvas. If you are doing a group project, include your Github username as a comment on the assignment submission (so we can be sure to track contributions by group members, just in case your Github username doesn't obviously map to your name in the course register or NetID).
